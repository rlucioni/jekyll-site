The US housing market has been an area of intense interest in recent years. Real estate plays an integral role in the US economy, representing a significant source of income for some and a significant investment for others. Residential real estate provides housing for individuals and their families, and often represents a familyâ€™s most significant investment. Commercial real estate provides space for offices, factories, and apartment buildings.

In the last several years, the conversation on the US housing market has focused on its recovery from the 2008 crisis. Nationwide housing trends are widely discussed in the news, and reports detailing local trends in locations such as Manhattan, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and more recently <a href="http://time.com/8731/highest-rent-in-us-williston-north-dakota/" target="_blank" title="Williston, North Dakota">Williston, North Dakota</a>, are common. However, these discussions often rely on a couple of raw statistics and rudimentary visualizations, and as such struggle to communicate effectively with readers. This can make it hard for audiences, even those who follow the news closely, to put the situation in context.

In an attempt to fill this communication gap, my friend Kathy Lin and I designed and built an interactive visualization meant to be used as a tool for exploring recent trends in the US housing market. A screenshot of the tool appears below. [Access it here](http://renzolucioni.com/recovery) - please note that it performs best on desktop.
