I led a team of five which sent a hamburger into the stratosphere and filmed the entire journey. We used a 600 gram weather balloon, 120 cubic feet of helium, a GoPro camera, an [HTC Rezound](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-rezound/) for cheap GPS, a parachute, and a styrofoam cooler for storing the electronics. We were sponsored by Boston-area hamburger chain [b.good](http://www.bgood.com/), and completed the project in under two weeks using less than $500. Here's the video we made.

We were parodied by Jay Leno on [The Tonight Show](http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/monologue-part-2-111212/1423754/). In addition, we were featured on the Yahoo! front page.
